Implement tasks from a Spectra change.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name (e.g., `$spectra-apply add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Task tracking is file-based only.** The tasks file's markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) are the single source of truth for progress. Do NOT use any external task management system, built-in task tracker, or todo tool. When a task is done, edit the checkbox in the tasks file — that is the only way to record progress.

**Prerequisites**: This skill requires the `spectra` CLI. If any `spectra` command fails with "command not found" or similar, report the error and STOP.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `spectra list --json` AND `spectra list --parked --json` to get all available changes (including parked ones). Parked changes should be annotated with "(parked)" in the selection list. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `$spectra-apply <other>`).

2. **Check status to understand the schema**

   ```bash
   spectra status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   **If the command fails**: show the error and STOP.

   **If the command succeeds**, check whether the change is parked (status can succeed even for parked changes):

   ```bash
   spectra list --parked --json
   ```

   Look for the change name in the `parked` array of the JSON output.
   - **If the change IS in the parked list** (it's parked):
     Inform the user that this change is currently parked（暫存）.
     Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask whether to continue.
     Two options:
     - **Continue**: Unpark the change and proceed with apply
     - **Cancel**: Stop the workflow

     If the user chooses to continue:

     ```bash
     spectra unpark "<name>"
     ```

     Then mark it as in-progress:

     ```bash
     spectra in-progress add "<name>"
     ```

     This is a silent operation — do not show the output to the user.

     Then re-run `spectra status --change "<name>" --json` and continue normally.

     If there is no AskUserQuestion tool available (non-Claude-Code environment):
     Inform the user that this change is currently parked（暫存）and ask via plain text whether to unpark and continue, or cancel.
     Wait for the user's response. If the user confirms, run `spectra unpark "<name>"`, then set `spectra in-progress add "<name>"`, and continue normally.

   - **If the change is NOT in the parked list**: mark it as in-progress and proceed normally.

     ```bash
     spectra in-progress add "<name>"
     ```

     This is a silent operation — do not show the output to the user.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   ```bash
   spectra instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   This returns:
   - Context file paths (varies by schema)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If `state: "blocked"` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using `$spectra-propose` to create the change artifacts first
   - If `state: "all_done"`: congratulate, suggest archive
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

3b. **Preflight check**

If the apply instructions JSON includes a `preflight` field, act on its `status`:

- **`"clean"`**: silently continue — no output needed.
- **`"warnings"`**: display a brief summary, then continue automatically:
  ```
  ⚠ Preflight warnings:
  - Drifted files (modified after change was created): <list paths>
  - Change is <N> days old
  Continuing...
  ```
  Only show the lines that are relevant (skip drifted if none, skip staleness if not stale).
- **`"critical"`**: display missing files with their source artifact, then use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask the user:

  ```
  ⚠ Preflight: missing files detected
  - <path> (referenced in <source artifact>)
  - ...
  These files are referenced in the change artifacts but no longer exist on disk.
  ```

  Options: "Continue anyway" / "Stop"
  If the user chooses "Stop", end the workflow.

  If there is no AskUserQuestion tool available:
  Display the same information as plain text and ask whether to continue or stop.
  Wait for the user's response.

If the `preflight` field is absent (blocked or all_done states), skip this step.

3c. **Artifact quality check**

Run `spectra analyze <change-name> --json` to check cross-artifact consistency (Coverage, Consistency, Ambiguity, Gaps).

- **Zero findings**: silently continue.
- **Warning/Suggestion only**: display a one-line summary (e.g., "⚠ Artifact analysis: 2 warnings found") and continue automatically.
- **Critical findings**: display each Critical finding (summary + location + recommendation), then use the **AskUserQuestion tool**:
  - **Fix and continue** — fix the artifact issues inline, then proceed
  - **Continue anyway** — skip fixes and start implementation
  - **Stop** — end the workflow

  If there is no AskUserQuestion tool available, present options as plain text and wait for the user's response.

3d. **Drift dormancy check** (passive trigger for stale changes)

When the change has been dormant for more than 5 days AND the change directory has had zero commits in the past 3 days, surface a drift report before tasks begin — the change is likely out-of-sync with the current codebase.

Detect dormancy from `.openspec.yaml` `created` and `git log -1 --format=%at -- docs/specs/changes/<name>/`:

- **Both conditions met**: run `spectra drift <change-name>`, display the report, then use the **AskUserQuestion tool**:
  - **Continue with apply** — proceed to tasks (recommended for Light drift)
  - **Refresh first** — pause apply, run `/spectra-ingest <change-name>` to update artifacts, then resume
  - **Stop** — end the workflow
- **Either condition not met**: silently continue, no output.

The trigger is guidance only — it MUST NOT block apply from proceeding when the user chooses to continue. Hard-blocking on dormancy would punish legitimate "I came back after a long weekend" cases.

(Threshold reasoning: AI-assisted commits are daily-cadence. ≥5 days dormant + ≥3 days no commit ≈ genuine stagnation, not normal pacing.)

If there is no AskUserQuestion tool available, present options as plain text and wait for the user's response.

4. **Read context files**

   Read the files listed in `contextFiles` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

5. **Check project preferences**

   Read `.spectra.yaml` in the project root.
   If `tdd: true` is set, apply TDD discipline throughout implementation:
   - For each task, write a failing test FIRST, then implement to make it pass
   - Fetch TDD instructions by running `spectra instructions --skill tdd`, then follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - For bug fixes, reproduce the bug with a failing test before fixing

   If `audit: true` is set, apply sharp-edges discipline throughout implementation:
   - When designing APIs or interfaces, evaluate through 3 adversary lenses (Scoundrel, Lazy Developer, Confused Developer)
   - When adding configuration options, verify defaults are secure and zero/empty values are safe
   - When accepting parameters, check for type confusion and silent failures
   - Fetch audit instructions by running `spectra instructions --skill audit`, follow the discipline checklist (not the standalone 3-agent workflow)

   If `parallel_tasks: true` is set, check whether consecutive pending tasks have `[P]` markers (format: `- [ ] [P] Task description`). You SHALL dispatch consecutive `[P]` tasks as parallel agents. Only fall back to sequential when tasks have a data dependency (one task's output is another's input) or when tasks modify overlapping regions of the same file. Targeting the same file alone is NOT a reason to skip parallel dispatch — if the modified regions are disjoint, dispatch in parallel. If the environment does not support parallel execution, ignore `[P]` markers and execute tasks sequentially.

6. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

7. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   **Reminder: Track progress by editing checkboxes in the tasks file only. Do not use any built-in task tracker.**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Re-read the sections of design and spec files that are relevant to this task's scope — do not rely on memory from earlier in the conversation, as context may have been compressed
   - **Read the Implementation Contract for this task before editing any source file.** If `design.md` exists and contains an `## Implementation Contract` section (or contract content under another heading the design uses), read the part of it that covers this task's scope. The contract names the observable behavior, interface or data shape, failure modes, acceptance criteria, and scope boundaries you must satisfy. Treat the contract as the durable handoff — it is what the task will be measured against, regardless of who started the change.
   - **Detect unclear or path-only tasks before writing code.** A task is unclear if it:
     - only names files to edit ("edit `foo.rs`", "update `bar.svelte`") with no behavior, contract, or verification target;
     - is vague ("handle edge cases", "wire it up", "make it work");
     - conflicts with the implementation contract (asks for behavior the contract excludes, or omits behavior the contract requires).
       When this happens, pause. Either update the artifact (design or tasks) so the task names a concrete behavior and verification target, or report the blocker and wait for guidance. Do NOT silently guess against unclear requirements.
   - Before writing code, check:
     1. **Reuse** — search adjacent modules and shared utilities for existing implementations before writing new code
     2. **Quality** — derive values from existing state instead of duplicating; use existing types and constants over new literals
     3. **Efficiency** — parallelize independent async operations; avoid unnecessary awaits; match operation scope to actual need
     4. **No Placeholders in artifacts** — if the design or spec for this task contains placeholder language (TBD, TODO, "add appropriate handling"), pause and fix the artifact first or flag to the user. Do not implement against vague requirements.
     5. **Examples as verification** — if the spec for this task's scope includes `##### Example:` blocks, use them as concrete test cases:
        - When TDD is enabled: derive the first failing test directly from the example's GIVEN/WHEN/THEN values
        - When TDD is not enabled: after implementing, verify the code handles the example's input→output correctly
        - Example tables map to parameterized tests — one test per row
          Do NOT invent additional test values beyond what the spec examples provide without reason. The examples ARE the agreed specification.
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - **Verify before marking done** — re-read the task description from the tasks file AND the relevant Implementation Contract content from design.md. For each requirement stated in the task description and each contract item that covers this task's scope, confirm it is addressed by your changes. Confirm the verification target named by the task (test name, CLI invocation, analyzer check, or manual assertion) actually passes. If any contract item, task requirement, or verification target is missing or failing, implement/fix it now. Do not mark the task complete until every part of the description is covered and the contract for this task is satisfied.
   - Mark task complete by running: `spectra task done --change "<name>" <task-id>`
     This command marks the checkbox in tasks.md AND records which files were modified for this task.
   - Continue to next task

   **Parallel task dispatch**: When consecutive `[P]`-marked tasks are found and `parallel_tasks: true` is configured (see Step 5), dispatch them as parallel agents in a single message. If any `[P]` task fails, pause and report.

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

8. **Final check**

   After completing all tasks, re-run:

   ```bash
   spectra instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Confirm `state: "all_done"`. If not, review remaining tasks and complete them.

9. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

```

**Guardrails**

- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names
- **No external task tracking** — do not use any built-in task management, todo list, or progress tracking tool; the tasks file is the only system
- If **AskUserQuestion tool** is not available, ask the same questions as plain text and wait for the user's response

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly
